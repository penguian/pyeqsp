# Contributing to PyEQSP

**Release 1.0b2** (2026-06-07): Copyright 2026 Paul Leopardi

Thank you for helping us refine the Recursive Zonal Equal Area Sphere Partitioning (**PyEQSP**) library! This project is currently in Beta testing, and your feedback is invaluable.

## How to Provide Feedback

### Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/penguian/pyeqsp/issues/new/choose) using the **Bug Report** template. Please include:
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Your environment details (OS, Python version, etc.).
- Any relevant plots or screenshots.

### Suggesting Enhancements
We welcome ideas for new features or improvements to the partitioning algorithms or visualizations. Please use the **Feature Request** template when [opening an issue](https://github.com/penguian/pyeqsp/issues/new/choose).

### Project Roadmap & Future Work
To see the current development priorities and items currently under consideration for future releases, please consult the [Release Roadmap](doc/maintainer/release_roadmap.md).

## Technical Contributions

> [!NOTE]
> The PyEQSP maintenance environment (scripts, benchmarks, and doc builds) currently assumes a **POSIX-compatible** system (Linux, macOS, or WSL). We actively seek **volunteer maintainers** with experience in macOS and native Windows to help harden our cross-platform infrastructure.

If you would like to contribute code fixes or improvements, please follow the forking workflow:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy of the `penguian/pyeqsp` repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone and Setup**:
   We recommend using a **virtual environment** to avoid dependency conflicts:
   ```bash
   # Create and activate a virtual environment
   python3 -m venv .venvs/.venv
   source .venvs/.venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venvs\.venv\Scripts\activate`

   # Clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pyeqsp.git
   cd pyeqsp

   # Install in "editable" mode with development tools
   pip install -e ".[dev]"

   # Install the git hooks
   pre-commit install
   ```
   > **What is "editable" mode (`-e`)?** This creates a link between your local code and your Python environment. Any changes you make to the code in this folder will take effect immediately without needing to reinstall. The `[dev]` extra installs linting and testing tools (`ruff`, `pylint`, `pytest`, `coverage`).

3. **Troubleshooting Installation**:
   If the `pip install` command fails, please:
   - Ensure your `pip` is up to date (`pip install --upgrade pip`).
   - Check the detailed environment setup guide in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
   - If you are still stuck, [open an issue](https://github.com/penguian/pyeqsp/issues/new) and we will help you!

4. **Draft your Changes**: We recommend creating a new branch for your fix or feature.
5. **Coding & Documentation Standards**:
   To maintain high code quality, we require:
   - **Linting**: Code must meet `ruff` and `pylint` (10.00/10).
   - **Linguistic Standard**: Adopt **Australian -ize English** (Oxford spelling). Use `-re` and `-our` (e.g., *centre*, *colour*) and `-ize`/`-yze` suffixes (e.g., *organized*, *analyze*).
   - **Docstrings**: Use the [NumPy docstring format](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).
   - **Code Coverage**: We maintain a strict **100% test coverage** policy.
       - All new features must include comprehensive tests.
       - `# pragma: no cover` should be used sparingly and only for truly unreachable code.
   - **Minimalism**: Keep changes focused and brief.

6. **Run Tests & Linters**: Ensure that your changes meet all quality checks and do not break existing functionality. While the **pre-commit hooks** automatically check your work each time you `git commit`, you can also manually run the full verification script:
   ```bash
   python3 validation/verify_all.py
   ```
   For more details on the relationship between `doctests` and `pytest`, see the [Testing Guide](doc/maintainer/testing_details.md).

7. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once your changes are ready, submit a Pull Request (PR) from your fork to our `main` branch.

### Syncing your Fork
If the main repository has been updated, you can sync your fork using:
```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

### Advanced Maintenance

For advanced topics about releasing, governance, publishing, and documentation design, please consult the [Maintenance Guide](doc/maintenance_guide.md) and [Documentation Maintenance Guide](doc/maintainer/documentation_maintenance.md).
