**Git Tag**: `release_0_99_8` | **Distribution**: `PyPI`

### Added
- **100% Automation Coverage**: Achieved full unit test coverage for the entire project maintenance ecosystem (Release & Validation tools) via `tests/src/test_ci_scripts.py`.
- **Infrastructure Semantic Reorganization**: Refactored the internal workspace to partition scripts into `release/` (packaging and hosting) and `validation/` (quality gates and metrics).
- **JOSS Submission Finalization**: Prepared the `paper.md` and `paper.bib` artifacts for the Journal of Open Source Software, incorporating a professional academic voice modeled after the 2024 JAS paper (@Leo24).

### Changed
- **Hardened Validation**: Updated `quality_check.py` and `check_links.py` with robust repository root pathing and standard `main()` entry points to ensure stability in pre-commit and CI environments.
- **Unified Documentation Alignment**: Synchronized all internal guides, checklists, and the `Maintenance Guide` with the new semantic directory layout.
- **Academic Lineage Alignment**: Established a dual-citation strategy, referencing the 2007 PhD thesis (@Leo07) for the algorithm's foundation and the 2024 JAS paper (@Leo24) for the definitive toolbox reference.
- **Hemisphere Partitioning Refinement**: Updated the `paper.md` narrative to highlight the library's support for equatorial alignment via the `even_collars` implementation decision, essential for $S^3$ to $\text{SO}(3)$ quaternion sampling.
- **Pre-commit Layer**: Hardened the pre-commit environment with updated hook definitions and expanded project-wide linting coverage.

### Fixed
- **Sphinx Infrastructure**: Created programmatic checks to enforce uniform indentation on `toctree` blocks in `index.rst`, preventing silent file dropping.
- **PR #21 Resolution**: Corrected `ruff.toml` include paths to scan `release/` and `validation/`, introduced Python AST parsing to validate `Usage:` docstrings, and corrected the *Journal of Approximation Software* reference.

## [0.99.7] - 2026-03-22
**Git Tag**: `release_0_99_7` | **Distribution**: `PyPI`

### Added
- **Pre-commit Layer**: Formalized the first tier of "Defense in Depth" by integrating pre-commit hooks for project-wide documentation quality, link validation, and Python linting.

### Fixed
- **CI & Local Hardening**: Resolved "module not found" errors in both GHA and local virtual environments by ensuring all documentation dependencies (Sphinx, MyST) are correctly synchronized.
- **Environment Isolation**: Enhanced `verify_all.py` to manage the system `PATH` dynamically, ensuring that subprocesses always use the tools from the active virtual environment and resolving path-shadowing failures.
- **Headless Doctests**: Mocks `mayavi` and `PyQt5` in `doc/conf.py` to allow 3D visualization doctests to pass in headless CI environments.
- **Environment Compatibility**: Reverted `ruff.toml` to the legacy-compatible flat configuration format to support restricted environments (e.g., `.venv_sys`).
- **Credential Validation**: Refined `upload_release.py` to correctly validate `TWINE_PASSWORD` (and handle tokens) without misidentifying `TWINE_TOKEN` as a standard variable.
- **Coverage Transparency**: Expanded `tests/run_coverage.py` to include the `scripts/` directory in formal quality and coverage reports.
- **Documentation Refinement**: Resolved `toc.not_included` warnings by properly indexing all historical release notes and formalizing the "Defense in Depth" strategy in the Maintenance Guide.
