## 0.99.9
**2026-04-09**

Release **0.99.9** achieves **100% project-wide coverage** across both the core library and the entire maintenance ecosystem. It finalizes the dimensional robustness and equatorial symmetry features for the stable 1.0 release.

### Key Features & Improvements
- **Equatorial Symmetry**: Expanded the `even_collars` parameter across the core API (`eq_regions`, `eq_point_set`, `eq_find_s2_region`, etc.) to ensure partitions align perfectly with the equatorial hyperplane.
- **Symmetric Benchmark Suite**: Added a full suite of even-collar benchmark runners (`run_benchmarks_even.py`) with 1-2-5 logarithmic scaling to verify performance parity.
- **Robustness Testing**: Extended formalized testing to higher dimensions ($S^4$ and $S^5$), verifying the recursive algorithm's mathematical stability for $dim \ge 4$.
- **Histogram Logic Alignment**: Back-ported "Index Rotation" (longitude lookup fix) into `eqsp/histograms.py` and implemented high-$N$ wrap-around tests. Removed legacy `lookup_table()` in favor of domain-translated `np.searchsorted()` for 100% coverage.
- **Verification Hardening**: Implemented robust venv isolation in `validation/verify_all.py` and corrected `sradius` dimension logic.
- **Histogram Boundary Safety**: Added index clamping to `lookup_s2_region` to prevent `IndexError` at poles.
- **CLI Standardization**: Refined `--even-collars` flag logic for intuitive explicit opt-in.
- **Verification Suite**: Integrated the unified `validation/verify_all.py` script and benchmark suite.
- **100% Coverage**: Reached 100% functional coverage across all maintenance and release tools.
- **Release Metadata Sync**: Updated versioning and copyright dates for the 1.0 release.
- **Documentation Parity**: Conducted a thorough audit of the benchmark suite documentation to ensure $S^2$ and $S^3$ default dimensions are explicitly noted across the User and Maintenance guides.
- **Master ToC Refinement**: Redesigned the master Table of Contents (`index.rst`) to resolve appendix numbering conflicts and correctly sequence volume references.
- **Local Config Isolation**: Isolated AI assistant skills and standardized virtual environment documentation with generic placeholders (`VENV`) for improved portability and privacy.
- **Environment Support**: Formalized the requirement for Mayavi-enabled environments for 3D visualization documentation builds.

- **100% Automation Coverage**: Achieved full unit test coverage for the CI/CD suite via the `test_ci_scripts.py` framework.
- **JOSS Submission**: Finalized the `paper.md` and `paper.bib` artifacts, harmonizing the project's scholarly identity with the 2007 PhD thesis [Leo07] and 2024 JAS paper [Leo24-JAS].
- **Quality Gate Stability**: Enhanced validation scripts with AST parsing to monitor paths inside Python `Usage:` blocks and enforced structural integrity in `index.rst`.
- **Hemisphere Refinement**: Explicitly documented the `even_collars` implementation for $S^3 \to \text{SO}(3)$ sampling applications.
