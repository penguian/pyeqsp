**Released: 2026-03-22** | **Git Tag: release_0_99_7** | **Distribution: PyPI**

- [x] **Pre-commit Layer**: Formalized the first tier of "Defense in Depth" (Item 1-2).

**Released: 2026-04-03** | **Git Tag: release_0_99_8** | **Distribution: PyPI**

- [x] **JOSS Submission**: Initiate the peer-review process by submitting the voice-modeled `paper.md` and `paper.bib` artifacts to the Journal of Open Source Software. This establishes the project's scholarly identity alongside the 2007 PhD thesis [Leo07] and 2024 JAS paper [Leo24-JAS].
- [x] **Automation Coverage Plan**: Achieved 100% coverage on the script automation hub (`release/`, `validation/`) using modular refactoring and the `test_ci_scripts.py` suite.

- [x] **Technical Symmetry Audit**: Reviewed historical and modern Sphinx configurations for project-wide consistency.
- [x] **Rename COPYING to LICENSE and adopt PEP 639**: Renamed `COPYING` → `LICENSE`; updated `pyproject.toml` with `license = "MIT"` and `license-files = ["LICENSE"]`.
- [x] **Rename `doc/internal/` to `doc/maintainer/`**: Reflected that these are public maintainer-facing docs. Updated all internal references.

### 0.99.9 Beta: Full Project Coverage & Dimensional Robustness
**Released: 2026-04-09** | **Git Tag: release_0_99_9** | **Distribution: PyPI**

- [x] **Histogram Logic Alignment**: Back-ported "Index Rotation" (longitude lookup fix) into `eqsp/histograms.py` and implemented high-$N$ wrap-around tests. Removed legacy `lookup_table()` in favor of domain-translated `np.searchsorted()` for 100% coverage.
- [x] **Coverage Deep-Dive**: Reached 100% functional coverage in all core maintenance and release scripts (`release/`, `validation/`) and core algorithm edge cases (e.g., $dim=1$ scalar paths).
- [x] **Higher-Dimension Robustness**: Verified recursive partitioning for $S^4$ and $S^5$, ensuring coordinate bounds and unit-norm properties hold for $dim \ge 4$.
- [x] **Benchmark Alignment**: Synchronized Python benchmark logic, warm-up phases, and $N_{max}$ parameters with the original MATLAB EQSP Toolbox. Implemented binary scaling (1-2-5) for symmetric benchmarks.
- [x] **Equatorial Symmetry Expansion**: Formalized `even_collars` support across the entire public API (including `eq_find_s2_region`).
- [x] **Verification Hardening**: Implemented robust venv isolation in `validation/verify_all.py` and corrected `sradius` dimension logic.
- [x] **Histogram Boundary Safety**: Added index clamping to `lookup_s2_region` to prevent `IndexError` at poles.
- [x] **CLI Standardization**: Refined `--even-collars` flag logic for intuitive explicit opt-in and added `os.pathsep` portability.
- [x] **Local Config & Environment Standardization**: Isolated AI assistant skills and standardized documentation with generic placeholders (`VENV`) for improved portability and privacy.
- [x] **Documentation Parity**: Conducted a thorough audit of the benchmark suite documentation to ensure $S^2$ and $S^3$ default dimensions are explicitly noted across the User and Maintenance guides.
- [x] **Doc Re-organization**: Refactored guides to use alphabetical appendices and renamed the Migration Guide to "Migration from MATLAB" with integrated performance baselines.
