# Appendix A: Technical Testing & Verification

This guide outlines the testing strategy, dependencies, and instructions for verifying the **PyEQSP** project and the `eqsp` package.

## Testing Strategy

The `eqsp` package uses a **Hybrid Testing Approach** that integrates standard unit tests with `doctest` examples to ensure documentation and code remain in sync.

### Test Categories

1.  **Unit Tests (`tests/src/test_*.py`)**:
    *   Verify core mathematical logic using static assertions.
    *   Compare results against known-good values from the original MATLAB implementation.
2.  **Mock Tests (`tests/src/*_mock.py`)**:
    *   Verify library interaction (e.g., PyVista/Matplotlib) without needing a display.
    *   Check if the correct arguments are passed to the plotting engines.
3.  **Extra Tests (`tests/src/*_extra.py`)**:
    *   Introspective integration tests.
    *   Use non-interactive backends (like Matplotlib's `Agg`) to verify that the rendered plot objects contain the expected mathematical labels and data properties.
4.  **Doctests**:
    *   Live-tested examples inside module docstrings.
    *   Ensures that every `>>>` example in the documentation is verified during test runs.

## Dependencies

Install development dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install pytest coverage
```

## Running Tests

### Project-Wide Run

We use a two-tier automated verification system:

1.  **Pre-commit Hooks (Local)**: Automated checks run on every `git commit` to catch linting errors, documentation typos, and broken links before they leave your machine.
    ```bash
    pre-commit install  # Run once to set up
    pre-commit run --all-files  # Run manually to verify everything
    ```

    > [!WARNING]
    > Pre-commit hooks must run inside the activated project virtual environment.
    > Here `VENV` is a placeholder for your virtual environment directory
    > (the project convention is `.venvs/.venv`; see [Installation Guide](../user/installation.md)).
    > The `Documentation Quality Check` hook (`validation/quality_check.py`) imports
    > `eqsp` at runtime, which requires `numpy` and other runtime dependencies. Running
    > `git commit` or `pre-commit run` with system `python3` (outside the venv) will
    > fail with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'`.
    >
    > Always activate the environment first:
    > ```bash
    > source VENV/bin/activate
    > ```
2.  **Unified Verification Script (Global)**: The `verify_all.py` script (located in `validation/`) is the definitive project-wide entry point.
    *   **Pull Requests**: Every PR must pass all pre-commit hooks and `python3 validation/verify_all.py` (Ruff, Pylint, Pytest).
    *   **Environment Orchestration**: Use `--venv DIR` to activate a specific environment and `--uninstall` to remove any existing `pyeqsp` package before running the suite. This prevents local source shadowing by stale `site-packages`.
    *   **CI Pipeline**: GitHub Actions runs `validation/verify_all.py` across Python 3.11–3.13.

The orchestrated script enforces a **Zero-Warning Policy** for the Sphinx documentation build (`make html SPHINXOPTS="-W"`), ensuring that no orphaned pages or malformed Table of Contents entries reach production.

### Granular Control
You can run tests at three levels of granularity:

1.  **By Module (Bridge)**:
    Runs both manual unit tests and bridged doctests for that module.
    ```bash
    pytest tests/src/test_point_set_props.py
    ```
2.  **By File (Direct)**:
    Runs **only** the doctests localized in that source file.
    ```bash
    python3 -m eqsp.point_set_props -v
    ```
3.  **Interactive Inspection**:
    To visually verify 2D or 3D output on your local machine:
    ```bash
    python3 tests/src/inspect_illustrations.py
    python3 tests/src/inspect_visualizations.py
    ```

### Visual Verification (Thesis Examples)

The `examples/phd-thesis/` directory contains high-fidelity scripts that reproduce figures from the canonical PhD thesis. Use these to verify that the library's results match the originally published data:

```bash
cd examples/phd-thesis
# Run a numerical plot (Agg backend, saves PNG)
python3 fig_4_2_min_dist_s2.py --upper-bound 5000

> **Note:** The virtual environment configuration (`VENV`) used for automated and manual testing was specific to a standardized Linux build (e.g. Kubuntu 25.10). For full 3D functionality, ensure that your environment has **PyVista** and its dependencies installed.

For instructions on running these scripts and a full mapping of scripts to thesis figures, see [Thesis Research Reproduction](../user/phd-thesis-examples.md).

## Code Coverage

To generate a full coverage report, use the provided helper script:

```bash
python3 tests/run_coverage.py
```

This will run all tests (including doctests) and produce a summary in the terminal. The project maintains a strict benchmark of **100% coverage**. A comprehensive pragma audit was conducted in 0.99 Beta to ensure that all testable code paths are exercised, and that existing pragmas are only applied to truly unreachable or environment-dependent code.

Detailed results are saved in `tests/results/run_coverage.log`.

### Private Implementation Tests

By default, the coverage script strictly excludes **private implementation tests** and **internal doctests** to maintain a clear boundary between the Public API and internal performance optimizations.

To include these high-fidelity tests in the coverage report, use the `--include-private` flag (benchmark: **100% coverage**):

```bash
python3 tests/run_coverage.py --include-private
```

Detailed results are saved in `tests/results/run_coverage_include_private.log`.

The private testing suite includes:
- **`tests/src/test_private_histograms.py`**: Verifies vectorized region lookup logic on S².
- **`tests/src/test_private_partitions.py`**: Bridge test for `eqsp._private._partitions` doctests.
- **`tests/src/test_private_region_props.py`**: Bridge test for `eqsp._private._region_props` doctests.

These tests ensure that internal mathematics optimizations (such as vectorized colatitude lookups) match the reference MATLAB logic with high precision.

### Diagnostic Tool Validation

To maintain the quality of the project's prevention mechanisms, the scripts in `validation/` are verified via:
- **Doctests**: Every diagnostic script includes embedded examples covering its core parsing and regex logic.
- **Orthography Scanning**: `quality_check.py` includes a specialized module to enforce the **Australian -ize English** standard, ensuring consistent Oxford spelling across all public prose. It also enforces canonical terminology (e.g., ensuring "N-sphere" rather than "Nrd-sphere") and catches positional-only argument violations in doc examples.
- **Structural Integrity**: The suite verifies that `ruff.toml` maintains its flat-format compatibility and ensures that all `# pragma: no cover` exclusions are effectively attached to statements.
- **Unit Tests (`tests/src/test_maintenance_scripts.py`)**: A dedicated suite that checks the functional I/O behaviour by mocking the repository filesystem. This ensures that tools like `check_links.py` and `quality_check.py` accurately identify and report errors in real-world scenarios.

All diagnostic scripts use **internal environment isolation** (via `sys.path`) and **headless Matplotlib configuration** to ensure they run consistently across diverse build environments without interfering with global system state or requiring a display.

**Environment Isolation**: The `validation/verify_all.py` script prepends the current Python executable's directory to the system `PATH`. This ensures that subprocesses (like `make` and `sphinx-build`) use the tools and packages from the active virtual environment, preventing conflicts with system-wide Python installations.

## Performance Benchmarking

The `benchmarks/` directory contains scripts to verify the algorithmic complexity and execution speed of core functions.

### Running the Suite
To run all system benchmarks and generate a summary report:
```bash
# Standard partitions
python3 benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py

# Symmetric (even-collar) partitions
python3 benchmarks/run_benchmarks_even.py
```

### Results and Logging
The runner saves individual results for each benchmark in a standardized format:
- **Standard Summary**: `benchmarks/results/run_benchmarks.log`
- **Symmetric Summary**: `benchmarks/results/run_benchmarks_even.log`
- **Standard Individual Logs**: `benchmarks/results/benchmark_*.log` (e.g., `benchmark_eq_regions.log`)
- **Symmetric Individual Logs**: `benchmarks/results/benchmark_*_even.log` (e.g., `benchmark_eq_regions_even.log`)

### Thesis Benchmark (Section 3.10.2)
The script `benchmarks/src/benchmark_eq_regions.py` specifically replicates the "Running time" benchmark from Section 3.10.2 of the thesis. It verifies the **$O(N^{0.6})$** scaling behaviour.

To run it independently with progress tracking:
```bash
python3 benchmarks/src/benchmark_eq_regions.py --show-progress
```

## Code Quality

The project uses `ruff` and `pylint` to maintain high code quality standards.

### Ruff (Style and Formatting)
Ruff handles fast linting and automatic formatting:
```bash
ruff check .
ruff format .
```

(configuration-compatibility)=
### Configuration Compatibility
The `ruff.toml` file uses a **flat configuration format** (omitting the `[lint]` section) to ensure compatibility across all project environments. This allows the same configuration to be parsed by both:
- **Modern Ruff** (0.15.x+) in the main `VENV`.
- **Legacy Ruff** (0.0.291) in specialized environments like `VENV_SYS` (`VENV_SYS` denotes a virtual environment created with `--system-site-packages`; see [Installation Guide](../user/installation.md)), where version constraints are imposed by system-managed plugins (e.g., `python-lsp-ruff`).

:::{important}
Newer Ruff versions will issue a deprecation warning about top-level settings, but they remain functional. This approach avoids breaking IDE integration in restricted environments.
:::

### Pylint (Deep Static Analysis)
Pylint is used for deep semantic analysis. The configuration is refined to allow standard mathematical notation (including variable names like `N_values`, `Ns`, `Phi`) while enforcing strict code quality across the entire repository. The project baseline is a **10.00/10** rating:
```bash
pylint eqsp benchmarks examples tests validation release  # Project-wide scan
```

### Vale (Optional Prose Linting)

The project includes a `.vale.ini` configuration for optional prose linting. Unlike `ruff` and `pylint`, `vale` is **not** part of the mandatory `validation/verify_all.py` suite and is not required for standard verification. It is intended for manual documentation audits.
