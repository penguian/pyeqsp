# Volume 2: The Maintenance Guide

This guide is intended for developers, contributors, and project maintainers of the **PyEQSP** library. It covers the technical architecture, optimization strategies, and the release lifecycle.

## Project Governance

### Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Scope | Production Credential Access |
|---|---|---|
| **Owner** | Full admin of GitHub, SourceForge, PyPI | Yes (all) |
| **Administrator** | CI secrets, API tokens, ReadTheDocs | Yes (scoped) |
| **Maintainer** | PR review, merges into `main`, release tags | No |
| **Contributor** | Forked PRs, bug reports, documentation | No |

### Security & Credential Management

Release operations to PyPI and SourceForge require owner or administrator credentials.
- **PyPI**: Use API tokens rather than account passwords. Store tokens in `~/.pypirc` or provide them via the `TWINE_PASSWORD` environment variable (the standard for both tokens and passwords).
- **SourceForge**: Managed via SSH keys. The `upload_sourceforge.py` script generates an `scp` command but does not execute it, allowing the maintainer to review and authenticate manually.

Non-owners should never have access to production secrets. All automation is designed to be run from developers' local machines using their own credentials.

## System Requirements for Maintenance

:::{important}
To date, all development and maintenance of PyEQSP has been performed exclusively on **Linux**.
:::

The maintenance infrastructure—including `verify_all.py`, the `release/` suite, and the documentation `Makefile`—currently assumes a **POSIX-compatible environment**. Developers using native Windows are encouraged to use **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** or manually adapt the scripts for their local environment. We provide no guarantees for non-POSIX platforms until they are formally verified by the community.

## Architecture & Design

The `eqsp` package is designed as a vectorized Python port of the original MATLAB toolbox. The core logic resides in:
- `eqsp/partitions.py`: Recursive zonal partitioning algorithms.
- `eqsp/point_set_props.py`: Metric calculation and energy summation.
- `eqsp/region_props.py`: Geometric property analysis.
- `eqsp/utilities.py`: Coordinate transforms and manifold mathematics.

For more details on the internal layout, see the [Design & Architecture](maintainer/design_and_architecture.md) guide.
For the transition from MATLAB, see the [Migration from MATLAB Toolbox](user/migration_matlab.md).

## Algorithmic Optimizations

PyEQSP leverages NumPy for vectorization and spatial indexing to achieve $O(N \log N)$ or $O(N)$ performance for most operations. Technical details can be found in:
- [Algorithmic Optimizations](maintainer/algorithmic_optimizations.md)
- [Performance Benchmarks](maintainer/benchmarks.md)

## Quality Assurance & Verification

We maintain a strict quality policy to ensure the reliability of the research outputs.

### Automated Verification

To prevent regressions, **pre-commit hooks** are used to validate every commit locally. Run once to set up:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
The hooks encompass formatting, linting, documentation quality checks, and link validation.

The primary project-wide entry point for global quality control is `verify_all.py` (located in `validation/`).
- **Pull Requests**: Every PR must pass all pre-commit hooks and `python3 validation/verify_all.py` (Ruff, Pylint, Pytest, Doctest). See the internal [Pull Request Checklist](maintainer/pr_checklist.md) for a manual pre-submission guide.
- **Environment Isolation**: Use `python3 validation/verify_all.py --venv DIR` to run the suite in a specific virtual environment. This automatically "deactivates" any currently active environment to ensure the audit runs against the intended site-packages.
- **Clean Verification**: Use `python3 validation/verify_all.py --uninstall` to remove any existing `pyeqsp` installation from the target environment. This is recommended to ensure that stale package data in `site-packages` does not shadow the local code being verified.
- **Maintenance & Infrastructure**: When modifying repository tools, scripts, or core documentation, follow the internal [Maintenance Implementation Checklist](maintainer/maintenance_implementation_checklist.md) to ensure tonal and technical consistency.
- **Pre-release**: Use `python3 validation/verify_all.py --pre-release` to build the distribution and verify metadata before any upload.

### Verification Strategy: Defense in Depth

PyEQSP employs a three-tier **"Defense in Depth"** strategy to ensure project-wide reliability:

-   **Layer 1: Pre-commit Hooks (Local)**: Provides rapid feedback for formatting, linting, and documentation errors before you commit code.
-   **Layer 2: Unified Verification Script (Local/Orchestration)**: A high-fidelity "dry run" that synchronizes the execution environment to verify 100% test coverage and build stability before you open a Pull Request.
-   **Layer 3: Continuous Integration (CI/Autoritative)**: Verifies the codebase in a clean-room environment across multiple Python versions (3.11–3.13) to catch platform regressions.

This layered approach is complemented by **Project-Specific Guardrails** that enforce research integrity (e.g., bibliographic consistency, manifold naming, and positional-only argument audits).

#### Technical Rationale: Local vs. Remote Hooks and Security Implications

The distinction between local and remote verification is fundamental to securing the release lifecycle and preserving repository integrity:

1.  **Local Pre-commit Hooks (Layer 1)**: Executed client-side, these hooks catch simple syntax, style, and formatting issues early. However, they are not security boundaries; developers can bypass local hooks (e.g., using `git commit --no-verify`), and local environments can be inconsistent (e.g., different dependency versions or local system configurations).
2.  **Authoritative Remote CI (Layer 3)**: Executed in a standardized, isolated virtual environment, the CI pipeline acts as the final gatekeeper. Because the CI configuration is checked into version control, it cannot be bypassed, and it ensures uniform environment execution.
3.  **Security Boundaries and Production Credentials**: Crucially, production credentials and API keys (such as PyPI tokens or SourceForge SSH keys) are never exposed to local hooks or arbitrary PR runners. Local scripts (like `upload_sourceforge.py` and `upload_release.py`) are deliberately designed to run on a maintainer's local machine using local credentials or prompts, ensuring that secrets never propagate to or reside in the shared remote CI environment.

## Documentation Management

Documentation is managed using Sphinx and MyST-Parser.
- **Build Command**: `cd doc && make html`
- **Configuration**: Managed via `doc/conf.py`.
- **Branding**: Ensure the distinction between the project name (**PyEQSP**) and the import name (`eqsp`) is maintained in all documents.
- **Linguistic Standard**: Adopt **Australian -ize English** (Oxford spelling).
  - Use `-re` and `-our` (e.g., *centre*, *colour*).
  - Prefer `-ize` and `-yze` suffixes (e.g., *organized*, *analyze*).

For standard operating procedures about building and hosting, see the [Documentation Maintenance Guide](maintainer/documentation_maintenance.md).

## Release & Lifecycle

### Release Procedures

PyEQSP uses a staging-based release workflow to protect the `main` branch from unverified distribution metadata:

1. **Staging & TestPyPI**: From a new **release branch**, use `release/upload_release.py --testpypi`. This automatically builds the distribution and uploads to TestPyPI for verification.
2. **Internal Review**: Review the TestPyPI project page to confirm that documentation links correctly point to absolute GitHub URLs.
3. **Integration & PR**: Push the release branch and open a PR to `main`. Once CI passes and the PR is merged, the authoritative `main` branch is ready for deployment.
4. **Production PyPI Upload & Tagging**: From the updated `main` branch, use `release/upload_release.py --pypi` for the deployment, then create and push the version tag (e.g., `git tag release_1_0b1 && git push origin release_1_0b1`).
5. **SourceForge Upload**: Use `release/upload_sourceforge.py` to host the mirror of the Sphinx HTML documentation. Note: the primary Sphinx HTML documentation is uploaded to [`readthedocs.io`](https://readthedocs.io) automatically.

For detailed instructions on these scripts, see **Appendix D**: [Upload Guide](maintainer/upload_guide.md).

### Branching and Tagging Strategy

PyEQSP follows a strategy where the `main` branch serves as the authoritative record for all production releases.

| Phase | Branch | Action | Upload Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Staging** | `release_branch_1_0b1` | Create branch; Version bump; `upload_release.py --testpypi` | **TestPyPI** |
| **2. Verification** | `release_branch_1_0b1` | Confirm rendering; Push PR to GitHub | *CI Only* |
| **3. Integration** | `main` | **Merge** PR into `main` | — |
| **4. Deployment** | `main` | `upload_release.py --pypi` | **Production PyPI** |
| **5. Snapshot** | `main` | `git tag release_1_0b1` | **GitHub Tags** |

#### Commits and Tags
Every release tag (e.g., `release_1_0b1`) is applied exclusively to the **merge commit** on the `main` branch. This ensures that the tag points to a state of the code that has been fully integrated, verified by CI, and matches the distribution uploaded to PyPI. Consequently, **tagged commits are always on the `main` branch**.

### Troubleshooting Release Issues

#### Version Mismatch on TestPyPI
If you install from TestPyPI and see an older version (e.g., seeing 0.99.3 when 0.99.4 was expected):

1. **Clear Pip Cache**: Pip may be using a cached version of a previous installation.
   ```bash
   pip install --no-cache-dir --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ pyeqsp
   ```
2. **Uninstall First**: Sometimes a clean uninstall is necessary before reinstalling.
   ```bash
   pip uninstall pyeqsp
   ```
3. **Check Propagation**: TestPyPI may take a minute to propagate new uploads. If the mismatch persists, verify the version on the [TestPyPI project page](https://test.pypi.org/project/pyeqsp/).

#### Production PyPI Upload Failure
If an upload to the production PyPI repository fails, it is often due to PyPI's strict immutability rules.

1.  **Check Immutability**: If any artifact (sdist or wheel) was successfully accepted before the failure, you **cannot** re-upload the same version string.
2.  **Consult Failure Recovery**: For a detailed step-by-step recovery process, see the **PyPI Immutability & Failure Recovery** caution in the [Upload Guide](maintainer/upload_guide.md).
3.  **Increment Version**: You must increment the version in `pyproject.toml` (e.g., to `1.0b2`) before restarting the release process.

### Historical Release Notes
Unlike the user-facing [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/penguian/pyeqsp/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md), which focuses on library features and API changes, the **Historical Release Notes** track the internal evolution of the project's infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and maintenance automation.

Detailed logs and historical metadata are tracked in:
- [Historical Release Notes](maintainer/release_notes.md): History of infrastructure changes and release-time quality metrics.
- [Release Roadmap](maintainer/release_roadmap.md): Strategic development phases and planned milestones.
